## R Markdown


```{r input}
source("0-packages.R")

# INPUT


```

# Native SOM
```{r summary table}
summary(cars)
```

```{r native van krev}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
